                We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where 
                the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus our process 
                around one central question: “What can we do to make this design more 
                efficient?”

                    Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be 
                    improved but also make revamps to the most critical parts of the design.

                    Design Report

                <p>
                    We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed 
                    visual report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for 
                    further work on the design.

                    Ways to Redesign

                <p>
                    We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers
                    to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a 
                    full redesign and quick but effective improvements.
